 I'm Raul Tizze, a composer and music producer who delves into the realm of profound and introspective sounds. Throughout my journey, I've released three solo albums, constantly driven by a passion for creating sonic landscapes that resonate with deep emotions and introspection.

What truly inspires me are interdisciplinary projects that push the boundaries of creativity, particularly within the realms of films, video games, and art installations. I find great joy in exploring the intricate connections between different artistic mediums, from composition and arrangement to sound design and mixing.
