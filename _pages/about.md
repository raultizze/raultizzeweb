I'm Raul Tizze, a composer and music producer who delves into the realm of profound and introspective sounds. Throughout my journey, I've released three solo albums, constantly driven by a passion for creating sonic landscapes that resonate with deep emotions and introspection.

What truly inspires me are interdisciplinary projects that push the boundaries of creativity, particularly within the realms of films, video games, and art installations. I find great joy in exploring the intricate connections between different artistic mediums, from composition and arrangement to sound design and mixing.

My artistic process is fueled by a genuine desire to evoke emotional responses through music. Drawing from a diverse range of genres and influences, I weave together captivating melodies and textured soundscapes that speak to the depths of the human experience.

Collaboration is at the heart of everything I do. By working closely with filmmakers, game developers, and visual artists, I aim to bring their visions to life through a carefully crafted sonic tapestry. Whether it's crafting an evocative score for a cinematic scene, composing atmospheric music for an immersive video game, or designing striking sounds for an avant-garde art installation, my goal is always to deliver high-quality results that surpass expectations.
